# SE_Assignment_M2

In this assignment, we will explore various programming constructs, including conditional statements like if-else, nested if-else, else-if ladders, and switch-case. We'll also examine looping structures and their practical applications. Additionally, we'll cover arrays, such as single-dimensional, two-dimensional, and multi-dimensional arrays. The assignment will further include the study of functions, string manipulation, and their implementation. Throughout, we will work with different data types such as int, char, float, and double to enhance our programming skills.
